## About
I'm a Ph.D. Student at Arizona State University, under the supervision of DR. Xusheng Xiao. I am interested in the field of computer security and deep learning.


## Research Projects

### Blogtag
Blogtag is a End-to-End blog-level automated classification system. It can input a long Internet log, output the type of the blog in the field of cyber security and determine whether it can be used for other knowledge extraction application.

### HPC cluster analysis system
Deploying the system auditing tool on HPC server cluster, building the log analysis system which generates graph-based log file, studying the characteristics of collected logs, and implementing a detection system for unexpected file deletion

### Pointextract
Pointextract is a pipeline for 2D X-ray image stacking. It removes background and noise by using Deeplab, and visualizes 3D object by using Open3D and 2D-3D reconstruction algorithms. Compared with other methods, it runs much faster and has better noise removing results.
